# DevOps/Agile Knowledge Portfolio

An opinionated knowledge and skill list to build effective **systems and teams**.
Currently, this is just a personal note and significant changes may be performed.

## Selection Policies

We shall use FLOSS in priority.
This is important to enhance the agility since the vendors are a kind of silos
when troubleshooting is needed.

We shall consider human interface design.
Software artifacts such as code, tools and documents are used by humans.
The more usability the system has, the more productivity the team has.
